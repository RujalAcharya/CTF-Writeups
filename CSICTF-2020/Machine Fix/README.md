# Machine Fix
<h3>Description</h3>
 We ran a code on a machine a few years ago. It is still running however we forgot what it was meant for. It completed n=523693181734689806809285195318 iterations of the loop and broke down. We want the answer but cannot wait a few more years. Find the answer after n iterations to get the flag.<br>
 The flag would be of the format csictf{answer_you_get_from_above}.
