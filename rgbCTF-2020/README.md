# rgbCTF 2020

Our team participated in rgbCTF 2020. It had a wide-range of challenges suitable for all the experience levels. Although we were just beginners and were unable to solve many challenges, we had a great learning experience.

We could solve some challenges from Beginners, Crypto, Forensics/OSINT, Misc and [ztc] categories. All of the challenges are still available at <a href='https://ctf.rgbsec.xyz/challenges'>https://ctf.rgbsec.xyz/challenges</a>.
